# Automated Attendance System - Presentation Materials

## Original Elevator Pitch
Tired of manual attendance tracking? Our Automated Attendance System uses real-time face recognition and your existing cameras—like webcams, phone cameras, or Raspberry Pi cameras—connected over your local network. Devices act as either camera providers or a central data center that automatically discovers cameras, identifies faces, and logs attendance. It's flexible, accurate, easy to set up, and eliminates the hassle of traditional methods.

## Alternative Elevator Pitch
**Transform your attendance process with our Automated Attendance System.** By leveraging advanced face recognition technology and your existing camera infrastructure, we eliminate manual check-ins completely. Any camera—smartphone, laptop webcam, or Raspberry Pi—instantly becomes a powerful attendance tracker on your local network. Our distributed architecture means unlimited scalability with zero additional hardware costs. Setup takes minutes, accuracy approaches 100%, and your attendance data is always available in real-time. Stop wasting resources on outdated tracking methods and join the future of attendance management today.

## Original Presentation Outline (3 Minutes)
